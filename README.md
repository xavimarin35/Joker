# Joker: The Final Show

Third-Person Shooter developed with [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?sessionInvalidated=true) by [Joan Barduena](https://github.com/JoanBarduena) and [Xavi Marín](https://github.com/xavimarin35).

The game is inspired by the [Joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(2019_film)) film of 2019. It starts just after Joker shoots Franklin Murray in the head while the show was broadcasting live. Then, the player takes control of Joker and his main objective will be escape from the crime scene. 

There are different paths that take you to the two bombs that you must plant, but it will not be easy because of the SWAT agents who want to kill you. Use the ammunition and medkits to survive and get to the helicopter on the top floor to escape.
